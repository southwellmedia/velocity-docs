import { Card, CardGrid, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Velocity works out of the box with major hosting platforms.

## Supported Platforms

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Vercel" icon="rocket">
    Recommended. Zero-config deployment with edge functions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Netlify" icon="laptop">
    Great for static sites with serverless functions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cloudflare Pages" icon="setting">
    Global edge network with Workers support.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Before Deploying

1. Set `SITE_URL` in your environment
2. Run `pnpm build` locally to catch errors
3. Test with `pnpm preview`

<Aside type="tip">
  Most platforms detect Astro automatically and configure the build for you.
</Aside>

## Build Output

Velocity builds to static files by default:

```bash
pnpm build
# Output in dist/
```

For server-side features, configure an adapter in `astro.config.mjs`.

## Environment Variables

Set these on your hosting platform:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SITE_URL` | Yes | Your production domain |
| `PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | No | Google Analytics ID |
| `PUBLIC_GTM_ID` | No | Google Tag Manager ID |
