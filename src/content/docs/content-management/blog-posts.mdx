Welcome to Velocity! In this guide, we'll walk through...

## Installation

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/southwellmedia/velocity.git
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

Continue to [configuration](/configuration) to customize your site.
```

## Images

### Cover Images

Place images next to your post and reference with relative paths:

```
src/content/blog/en/
├── my-post.mdx
└── cover.jpg
```

```yaml
image: ./cover.jpg
```

### Inline Images

```markdown
![Alt text](./screenshot.png)
```

<Aside type="tip">Images are automatically optimized during build.</Aside>

## Draft Posts

Mark posts as drafts to hide them in production:

```yaml
draft: true
```

Draft posts:

- Visible in development
- Hidden in production builds
- Useful for work-in-progress content

## Featured Posts

Mark posts for featured sections:

```yaml
featured: true
```

Query featured posts:

```astro
const featured = posts.filter(post => post.data.featured);
```

## Localization

Organize posts by locale:

```
src/content/blog/
├── en/           # English posts
├── es/           # Spanish posts
└── fr/           # French posts
```

Filter by locale:

```astro
const enPosts = posts.filter(post => post.data.locale === 'en');
```
